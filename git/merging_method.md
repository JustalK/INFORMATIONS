# How to merge

## Fixing via merge:

```
$ git fetch origin         # gets latest changes made to master
$ git checkout feature     # switch to your feature branch
$ git merge master         # merge with master
```

```
# resolve any merge conflicts here
$ git push origin feature  # push branch and update the pull request
```
